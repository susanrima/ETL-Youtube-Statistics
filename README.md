ETl Project | Youtube Statistics

Background


Our extraction process started with reviewing available datasets from kaggle.com. Our goal was to find datasets with large volume of records with relevant data which can be used for analysis.
We came across a collection of datasets on trending YouTube video statistics which had datasets for different countries in both csv and json formats. Each dataset had over 41k records and had a lot of data(columns) with some good potential for cleanup as well. 
All these aligned with our goal for this project and we decided to proceed with this collection and to limit our analysis within North America, we picked the datasets for US, Canada and Mexico. 

We proposed compiling these data to better understand YouTube video popularity during an 8-month span (November 2017 - June 2018). Specifically, to determine what videos are most popular, how long it took to become trending, if certain categories tend to be more popular than others, and whether the observed trends are consistent across all of North America or if each country has a unique experience.
